    <h3>An overview</h3>
  <article>
    <p>So your time in <a href="opt.html">OPT</a> is running out. You can either enroll in a master's degree program and beef up your credentials, which would qualify you for an additional 12 months of OPT after graduation, or you can find a company to sponsor you for an H-1B visa by hiring you in a position related to your field of study. The H-1B visa allows for up to six years of legal employment in the United States with the sponsoring employer.</p>

      <h3>Special rule for United States master's degree recipients</h3>
    <article>
      <p>If you have a master's degree from the United States, you have about a 70 percent chance of your petition being selected because 20,000 of the H-1B visa quota are set aside for individuals like you.</p>

    <h3>The problems with the H-1B visa</h3>
  <article>

    <p>You've managed to dutifully complete your degree requirements and, because of your knowledge and abilities, have been identified by an employer as a desired candidate. But there's a couple of little issues...</p>

    <p>There are only 65,000 H-1B visas available each year for over 300,000 individuals who have filed petitions. That means that you have less than a 25 percent chance of your petition being selected in the lottery system implemented by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency responsible for processing the petitions.</p>

    <p>Petitions are only received within the first three days of April, and if you are lucky enough to be selected and later even luckier enough to be approved, you may begin working for your employer on October 1, the first day of the United States fiscal year.</p>

    <aside>
      <p>The H-1B visa has been mired in controversy for several years. <em>CNNMoney</em> produced the following clip on the messiness surrounding it:</p>
