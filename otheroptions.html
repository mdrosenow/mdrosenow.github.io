  <p>There are other not-so-common ways of remaining in the United States legally after getting your degree. The list below is not exhaustive.</p>

  <section>
  <h2>E Visa (Treaty Trader or Investor)</h2>
  <article>
    <p>International trade or entrepreneurial activity by individuals from a country that has a special treaty with the United States may lead to qualification for an E-1 (trader) or E-2 (investor) visa. For the complete list of treaty countries, <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/fees/treaty.html">click here</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are a treaty-country national and conduct a significant amount of trade between the United States and your country, you may be eligible for an <strong>E-1 visa</strong>.</p>

    <p>Likewise, if you are from a treaty country and you invest a substantial amount of money (the law does not specify an amount) in a business that you will own and operate, you may be eligible for an <strong>E-2 visa</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Extraordinary Ability Visa</h2>
  <article>
    <p>Have you won a Grammy, Oscar, Olympic Gold Medal or similar, major internationally or nationally recognized award? Are you otherwise an individual of "extraordinary ability" in your field of endeavor? If the answer to either of these questions is yes, you may be eligible for an <strong>EB-1-1 Extraordinary Ability visa</strong>, which would entitle you to a green card with no need for a sponsoring employer.</p>

    <p>If you do not wish to reside in the United States permanently but you are an individual of extraordinary ability in your field of work, you may temporarily reside in the United States to work in your field with an <strong>O-1 visa</strong>.</p>

    <h2>U Visa (Victim of Crime)</h2>
  <article>
    <p>If you have been the victim of a crime in the United States and suffered physical or emotional harm as a result of that crime, you may be eligible for a <strong>U visa</strong>. Congress designed the visa to allow for criminal victims to remain in the country and testify or cooperate with law enforcement authorities in order to prevent future crimes.</p>
